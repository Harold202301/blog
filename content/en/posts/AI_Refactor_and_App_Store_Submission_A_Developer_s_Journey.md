April 3rd – AI Got a Glow-Up
Yo, so I straight-up refactored the whole AI unit today. Nah, not just tweakin’—full reconstruction! 🧠⚡ Had to make sure this thing run smoother than butter on a hot skillet.

April 4th – App Store Rollercoaster 🎢
Finally hit "Submit" for that market review… aaaand—
BAM! Rejected. 💀
"Nah, fam, fix this first."
Back to the lab, ya know? Gotta tweak, adjust, and resubmit. The grind don’t stop. 💪

April 5th – Out With the Old
Decided to scrap ALL subscription stuff—ain’t nobody got time for that clutter. 🗑️
Also whipped up a fresh support page so y’all can hit me up proper. 📩

Lesson?
Coding life be like: Build. Break. Fix. Repeat. 🔄 But we stay winnin’. 🏆
