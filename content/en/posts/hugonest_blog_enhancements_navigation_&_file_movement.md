What's up, HUGONEST crew!

Another day, another round of code wrangling. Kept the momentum going today, focusing on smoothing out some core experiences within the app.

Today's big focus was on the blogging features. Specifically, I implemented navigation between blog posts. You know, the classic "Next Post" / "Previous Post" links you see everywhere? Yep, HUGONEST has that now! Should make browsing through content a whole lot easier and keep people engaged without having to jump back to an index page constantly. Small change, big usability win (I hope!).

On top of that, I circled back to the file management side of things. Remember how you could upload and view files? Well, now you can actually MOVE them! ðŸŽ‰ It sounds basic, but it's a crucial step for proper organization. No more clunky workarounds if you decide a file belongs in a different folder. Just drag it (or, well, use the 'move' command) and boom, it's there. Still more to do on the file manager, but this felt like a necessary piece to get in place.

Making steady progress and ticking things off the list! Always feels good.

As always, I'm building this out in the open, so your feedback is gold. How's the blog experience shaping up for you? Any specific file management tools you're hoping for next? Hit me up in the comments!

Cheers
