Aight fam, quick update on what your boy been workin' on for HugoNest the last couple days. Been grindin'.

1.  **Newbie Guide is LIVE:** First off, gotta look out for the new folks, right? Dropped a new onboarding guide in the app. Should make jumpin' in way smoother, show you the ropes so you ain't gotta guess. Gettin' y'all set up proper. ✨

2.  **AI Formatting Got That Glow Up:** That AI helpin' you format posts? Yeah, gave it a tune-up. It's way better now at makin' your stuff look clean without you havin' to sweat the small stuff. Should be smarter, less hassle. 💪

3.  **AI Backend Secured:** Moved the AI brain over to Cloudflare, you know, for that speed and stability. BUT also locked it down with some verification. Can't have bots runnin' wild and messin' things up, feel me? Keepin' the playground clean. 🔒

4.  **Recent Posts Make Sense Now:** Real talk, that 'Recent Posts' list was kinda buggin'. Fixed it so now it sorts by the *last time you actually edited* somethin'. Makes way more sense for findin' that draft you were just workin' on. Should be less diggin'. 💯

That's the quick rundown. Puttin' in work to make HugoNest solid for y'all.

Lemme know what you think. Back to the code cave. Peace! ✌️
