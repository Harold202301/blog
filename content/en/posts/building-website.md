Yo, so the HugoNest project is still chugging along. It’s just my lil’ side gig, so don’t expect lightning-fast progress or anything. Today’s grind was all about slapping together the website—sounds chill on paper, but man, it’s a total pain in the ass when you actually get into it. Still got a metric ton of stuff to tackle, and don’t even get me started on the docs… haven’t even touched that mess yet.
