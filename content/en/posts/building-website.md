## HugoNest Project Update – March 27, 2025

The [HugoNest](/posts/what-is-hugonest/) project continues to be developed as a personal side initiative. While progress is being made, it's important to note that development is ongoing at a steady pace, and significant breakthroughs aren’t anticipated.

### Today’s Activities

Today's focus was on building the website.  Although the task appears straightforward, the actual implementation presented numerous challenges – a testament to the complexity of the project.

### Ongoing Tasks

A substantial amount of work remains to be completed. Specifically, the documentation (referred to as "the docs") has yet to be addressed.  Further development will concentrate on expanding the core functionality and refining the user experience.
