Hey everyone!

Hope you're all doing great. Just wanted to share what I've been hammering away at for HUGONEST over the past day or so. Been focused on a couple of features I know folks have been asking for (or will appreciate!).

First up, HUGE news for all you night owls (and anyone who just digs a sleeker look): Dark Mode is officially in! ðŸŒ™ Spent a good chunk of time getting this dialed in. The best part? It's not just an on/off switch â€“ I made sure it hooks into your system settings. So, if your OS flips to dark mode at sunset, HUGONEST will follow right along. Of course, you'll still have the option to manually set it if that's more your style. Pretty stoked about how this turned out visually.

Also managed to knock out GitHub login integration. ðŸ’ª Been wanting to add more convenient ways to get you guys logged in, and GitHub felt like a natural fit for a lot of potential users. Should make hopping into HUGONEST a bit smoother for those of you already living in the GitHub ecosystem.

Felt like a super productive session! Getting these foundational pieces and user comfort features in place feels really good.

What do you guys think? Excited for Dark Mode? Any other login methods you're dying to see? Let me know below!
